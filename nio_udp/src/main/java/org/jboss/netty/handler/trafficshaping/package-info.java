/**
 * Implementation of a Traffic Shaping Handler and Dynamic Statistics.<br>
 * <br><br>
 *
 *
 * <P>The main goal of this package is to allow to shape the traffic (bandwidth limitation),
 * but also to get statistics on how many bytes are read or written. Both functions can
 * be active or inactive (traffic or statistics).</P>
 *
 * <P>Three classes implement this behavior:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li> <tt>PerformanceCounter</tt>: this class is the kernel of the package. It can be accessed to get some extra information
 * like the read or write bytes since last check, the read and write bandwidth from last check...</li><br><br>
 *
 * <li> <tt>PerformanceCounterFactory</tt>: this class has to be implemented in your code in order to implement (eventually empty)
 * the accounting method. This class is a Factory for PerformanceCounter which is used in the third class to create the
 * necessary PerformanceCounter according to your specifications.</li><br><br>
 *
 * <li> <tt>TrafficShapingHandler</tt>: this class is the handler to be inserted in your pipeline. The insertion can be wherever
 * you want, but <b>it must be placed before any <tt>MemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor</tt> in your pipeline</b>.</li><br>
 * <b><i>It is really recommended
 * to have such a</i> <tt>MemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor</tt> <i>(either non ordered or </i><tt>OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor</tt>
 * <i>) in your pipeline</i></b>
 * when you want to use this feature with some real traffic shaping, since it will allow to relax the constraint on
 * NioWorker to do other jobs if necessary.<br>
 * Instead, if you don't, you can have the following situation: if there are more clients
 * connected and doing data transfer (either in read or write) than NioWorker, your global performance can be under your specifications or even
 * sometimes it will block for a while which can turn to "timeout" operations.
 * For instance, let says that you've got 2 NioWorkers, and 10 clients wants to send data to your server. If you set a bandwidth limitation
 * of 100KB/s for each channel (client), you could have a final limitation of about 60KB/s for each channel since NioWorkers are
 * stopping by this handler.<br>
 * When it is used as a read traffic shaper, the handler will set the channel as not readable, so as to relax the NioWorkers.<br><br>
 * The method <tt>getMessageSize(MessageEvent)</tt> has to be implemented to specify what is the size of the object to be read or write
 * accordingly to the type of object. In simple case, it can be as simple as a call to <tt>getChannelBufferMessageSize(MessageEvent)</tt>.<br>
 * </ul></P>
 *
 * <P>Standard use could be as follow:</P>
 *
 * <P><ul>
 * <li>To activate or deactivate the traffic shaping, change the value corresponding to your desire as
 * [Global or per Channel] [Write or Read] Limitation in byte/s.</li><br>
 * <tt>PerformanceCounterFactory.NO_LIMIT</tt> (-1)
 * stands for no limitation, so the traffic shaping is deactivate (on what you specified).<br>
 * You can either change those values with the method <tt>changeConfiguration</tt> in PerformanceCounterFactory or
 * directly from the PerformanceCounter method <tt>changeConfiguration</tt>.<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <li>To activate or deactivate the statistics, you can adjust the delay to a low (not less than 200ms
 * for efficiency reasons) or a high value (let say 24H in ms is huge enough to not get the problem)
 * or even using <tt>PerformanceCounterFactory.NO_STAT</tt> (-1)</li>.<br>
 * And if you don't want to do anything with this statistics, just implement an empty method for
 * <tt>PerformanceCounterFactory.accounting(PerformanceCounter)</tt>.<br>
 * Again this can be changed either from PerformanceCounterFactory or directly in PerformanceCounter.<br><br>
 *
 * <li>You can also completely deactivate channel or global PerformanceCounter by setting the boolean to false
 * accordingly to your needs in the PerformanceCounterFactory. It will deactivate the global Monitor. For channels monitor,
 * it will prevent new monitors to be created (or reversely they will be created for newly connected channels).</li>
 * </ul></P><br><br>
 *
 * <P>So in your application you will create your own PerformanceCounterFactory and setting the values to fit your needs.</P>
 * <tt>MyPerformanceCounterFactory myFactory = new MyPerformanceCounter(...);</tt><br><br><br>
 * <P>Then you can create your pipeline (using a PipelineFactory since each TrafficShapingHandler must be unique by channel) and adding this handler before
 * your MemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor:</P>
 * <tt>pipeline.addLast("MyTrafficShaping",new MyTrafficShapingHandler(myFactory));</tt><br>
 * <tt>...</tt><br>
 * <tt>pipeline.addLast("MemoryExecutor",new ExecutionHandler(memoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor));</tt><br><br>
 *
 * <P>TrafficShapingHandler must be unique by channel but however it is still global due to
 * the PerformanceCounterFactcory that is shared between all handlers across the channels.</P>
 *
