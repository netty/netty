/**
 * A random and sequential accessible sequence of zero or more bytes (octets).
 * This interface provides an abstract view for one or more primitive byte
 * arrays ({@code byte[]}) and {@linkplain ByteBuffer NIO buffers}.
 *
 * <h3>Creation of a buffer</h3>
 *
 * It is recommended to create a new buffer using the helper methods in
 * {@link Unpooled} rather than calling an individual implementation's
 * constructor.
 *
 * <h3>Random Access Indexing</h3>
 *
 * Just like an ordinary primitive byte array, {@link ByteBuf} uses
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering">zero-based indexing</a>.
 * It means the index of the first byte is always {@code 0} and the index of the last byte is
 * always {@link #capacity() capacity - 1}.  For example, to iterate all bytes of a buffer, you
 * can do the following, regardless of its internal implementation:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@link ByteBuf} buffer = ...;
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; buffer.capacity(); i ++) {
 *     byte b = buffer.getByte(i);
 *     System.out.println((char) b);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Sequential Access Indexing</h3>
 *
 * {@link ByteBuf} provides two pointer variables to support sequential
 * read and write operations - {@link #readerIndex() readerIndex} for a read
 * operation and {@link #writerIndex() writerIndex} for a write operation
 * respectively.  The following diagram shows how a buffer is segmented into
 * three areas by the two pointers:
 *
 * <pre>
 *      +-------------------+------------------+------------------+
 *      | discardable bytes |  readable bytes  |  writable bytes  |
 *      |                   |     (CONTENT)    |                  |
 *      +-------------------+------------------+------------------+
 *      |                   |                  |                  |
 *      0      <=      readerIndex   <=   writerIndex    <=    capacity
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Readable bytes (the actual content)</h4>
 *
 * This segment is where the actual data is stored.  Any operation whose name
 * starts with {@code read} or {@code skip} will get or skip the data at the
 * current {@link #readerIndex() readerIndex} and increase it by the number of
 * read bytes.  If the argument of the read operation is also a
 * {@link ByteBuf} and no destination index is specified, the specified
 * buffer's {@link #writerIndex() writerIndex} is increased together.
 * <p>
 * If there's not enough content left, {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException} is
 * raised.  The default value of newly allocated, wrapped or copied buffer's
 * {@link #readerIndex() readerIndex} is {@code 0}.
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Iterates the readable bytes of a buffer.
 * {@link ByteBuf} buffer = ...;
 * while (buffer.isReadable()) {
 *     System.out.println(buffer.readByte());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Writable bytes</h4>
 *
 * This segment is a undefined space which needs to be filled.  Any operation
 * whose name starts with {@code write} will write the data at the current
 * {@link #writerIndex() writerIndex} and increase it by the number of written
 * bytes.  If the argument of the write operation is also a {@link ByteBuf},
 * and no source index is specified, the specified buffer's
 * {@link #readerIndex() readerIndex} is increased together.
 * <p>
 * If there's not enough writable bytes left, {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException}
 * is raised.  The default value of newly allocated buffer's
 * {@link #writerIndex() writerIndex} is {@code 0}.  The default value of
 * wrapped or copied buffer's {@link #writerIndex() writerIndex} is the
 * {@link #capacity() capacity} of the buffer.
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Fills the writable bytes of a buffer with random integers.
 * {@link ByteBuf} buffer = ...;
 * while (buffer.maxWritableBytes() >= 4) {
 *     buffer.writeInt(random.nextInt());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Discardable bytes</h4>
 *
 * This segment contains the bytes which were read already by a read operation.
 * Initially, the size of this segment is {@code 0}, but its size increases up
 * to the {@link #writerIndex() writerIndex} as read operations are executed.
 * The read bytes can be discarded by calling {@link #discardReadBytes()} to
 * reclaim unused area as depicted by the following diagram:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  BEFORE discardReadBytes()
 *
 *      +-------------------+------------------+------------------+
 *      | discardable bytes |  readable bytes  |  writable bytes  |
 *      +-------------------+------------------+------------------+
 *      |                   |                  |                  |
 *      0      <=      readerIndex   <=   writerIndex    <=    capacity
 *
 *
 *  AFTER discardReadBytes()
 *
 *      +------------------+--------------------------------------+
 *      |  readable bytes  |    writable bytes (got more space)   |
 *      +------------------+--------------------------------------+
 *      |                  |                                      |
 * readerIndex (0) <= writerIndex (decreased)        <=        capacity
 * </pre>
 *
 * Please note that there is no guarantee about the content of writable bytes
 * after calling {@link #discardReadBytes()}.  The writable bytes will not be
 * moved in most cases and could even be filled with completely different data
 * depending on the underlying buffer implementation.
 *
 * <h4>Clearing the buffer indexes</h4>
 *
 * You can set both {@link #readerIndex() readerIndex} and
 * {@link #writerIndex() writerIndex} to {@code 0} by calling {@link #clear()}.
 * It does not clear the buffer content (e.g. filling with {@code 0}) but just
 * clears the two pointers.  Please also note that the semantic of this
 * operation is different from {@link ByteBuffer#clear()}.
 *
 * <pre>
 *  BEFORE clear()
 *
 *      +-------------------+------------------+------------------+
 *      | discardable bytes |  readable bytes  |  writable bytes  |
 *      +-------------------+------------------+------------------+
 *      |                   |                  |                  |
 *      0      <=      readerIndex   <=   writerIndex    <=    capacity
 *
 *
 *  AFTER clear()
 *
 *      +---------------------------------------------------------+
 *      |             writable bytes (got more space)             |
 *      +---------------------------------------------------------+
 *      |                                                         |
 *      0 = readerIndex = writerIndex            <=            capacity
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Search operations</h3>
 *
 * For simple single-byte searches, use {@link #indexOf(int, int, byte)} and {@link #bytesBefore(int, int, byte)}.
 * {@link #bytesBefore(byte)} is especially useful when you deal with a {@code NUL}-terminated string.
 * For complicated searches, use {@link #forEachByte(int, int, ByteProcessor)} with a {@link ByteProcessor}
 * implementation.
 *
 * <h3>Mark and reset</h3>
 *
 * There are two marker indexes in every buffer. One is for storing
 * {@link #readerIndex() readerIndex} and the other is for storing
 * {@link #writerIndex() writerIndex}.  You can always reposition one of the
 * two indexes by calling a reset method.  It works in a similar fashion to
 * the mark and reset methods in {@link InputStream} except that there's no
 * {@code readlimit}.
 *
 * <h3>Derived buffers</h3>
 *
 * You can create a view of an existing buffer by calling one of the following methods:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #duplicate()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #slice()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #slice(int, int)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #readSlice(int)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #retainedDuplicate()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #retainedSlice()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #retainedSlice(int, int)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #readRetainedSlice(int)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * A derived buffer will have an independent {@link #readerIndex() readerIndex},
 * {@link #writerIndex() writerIndex} and marker indexes, while it shares
 * other internal data representation, just like a NIO buffer does.
 * <p>
 * In case a completely fresh copy of an existing buffer is required, please
 * call {@link #copy()} method instead.
 *
 * <h4>Non-retained and retained derived buffers</h4>
 *
 * Note that the {@link #duplicate()}, {@link #slice()}, {@link #slice(int, int)} and {@link #readSlice(int)} does NOT
 * call {@link #retain()} on the returned derived buffer, and thus its reference count will NOT be increased. If you
 * need to create a derived buffer with increased reference count, consider using {@link #retainedDuplicate()},
 * {@link #retainedSlice()}, {@link #retainedSlice(int, int)} and {@link #readRetainedSlice(int)} which may return
 * a buffer implementation that produces less garbage.
 *
 * <h3>Conversion to existing JDK types</h3>
 *
 * <h4>Byte array</h4>
 *
 * If a {@link ByteBuf} is backed by a byte array (i.e. {@code byte[]}),
 * you can access it directly via the {@link #array()} method.  To determine
 * if a buffer is backed by a byte array, {@link #hasArray()} should be used.
 *
 * <h4>NIO Buffers</h4>
 *
 * If a {@link ByteBuf} can be converted into an NIO {@link ByteBuffer} which shares its
 * content (i.e. view buffer), you can get it via the {@link #nioBuffer()} method.  To determine
 * if a buffer can be converted into an NIO buffer, use {@link #nioBufferCount()}.
 *
 * <h4>Strings</h4>
 *
 * Various {@link #toString(Charset)} methods convert a {@link ByteBuf}
 * into a {@link String}.  Please note that {@link #toString()} is not a
 * conversion method.
 *
 * <h4>I/O Streams</h4>
 *
 * Please refer to {@link ByteBufInputStream} and
 * {@link ByteBufOutputStream}.
