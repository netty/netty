/**
 * The {@code CompositeBuffer} is a concrete {@link Buffer} implementation that make a number of other buffers appear
 * as one. A composite buffer behaves the same as a normal, non-composite buffer in every way, so you normally don't
 * need to handle them specially.
 * <p>
 * A composite buffer is constructed using one of the {@code compose} methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link BufferAllocator#compose(Iterable)} creates a composite buffer from the buffers that are sent to it via
 *         the passed in send objects. Since {@link Send#receive()} transfers ownership, the resulting composite buffer
 *         will have ownership, because it is guaranteed that there are no other references to its constituent buffers.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link BufferAllocator#compose(Send)} creates a composite buffer with a single component.
 *         Since {@link Send#receive()} transfers ownership, the resulting composite buffer
 *         will have ownership, because it is guaranteed that there are no other references to its constituent buffer.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link BufferAllocator#compose()} creates an empty, zero capacity, composite buffer. Such empty buffers may
 *         change their {@linkplain #readOnly() read-only} states when they gain their first component.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * Composite buffers can later be extended with internally allocated components, with {@link #ensureWritable(int)},
 * or with externally allocated buffers, using {@link #extendWith(Send)}.
 *
 * <h3>How buffers compose</h3>
 *
 * A buffer can be thought of as having three distinct regions, in order:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Memory that have been read.</li>
 *     <li>Memory that is readable.</li>
 *     <li>Memory that can be written to.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * A composite buffer must present itself similarly, but may be composed of buffers where their offsets don't line up,
 * and thus end up producing "gaps" in the composite buffer.
 * The solution is that the composite buffer hide these gaps from view.
 * <p>
 * For example, if we compose two buffers that both have non-zero read-offset, then the composite buffer will get the
 * read-offset of the first buffer, followed by a concatenation of the readable memory from both.
 * Similarly, the write-offset of the composite buffer will come from the last buffer with a non-zero write-offset,
 * and any writable memory prior to the last readable memory region will be hidden:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     First buffer                Second buffer
 *      +----------------------+    +--------------------+
 *     0|    |r/o      |w/o    |   0|    |r/o     |w/o   |
 *      +----+---------+-------+    +----+--------+------+
 *       \    \         \  ,____________/   ,___________/
 *        \    \         \/                /
 *         +----+---------+--------+------+
 *        0|    |r/o      :        |w/o   |  Composite buffer
 *         +------------------------------+
 * </pre>
 *
 * Components in the middle can have both their end-regions hidden in the same way, so only their readable memory is
 * included in the composite buffer.
 * Buffers that consist entirely of memory that has already been read, or memory that is writable, can also concatenate
 * onto those regions at the ends.
 * The final capacity of the composite buffer, will be the sum of all the visible regions.
 * <p>
 * Reads and writes to the composite buffer that modifies the read or write offsets, will also modify the relevant
 * offsets in the constituent buffers.
 *
 * <h3>Constituent buffer requirements</h3>
 *
 * The buffers that are being composed must all have the same writability.
 * Either all components must be {@linkplain Buffer#readOnly() read-only}, or they must all be writable.
 * <p>
 * It is not a requirement that the buffers have the same size.
 * <p>
 * It is not a requirement that the buffers are allocated by this allocator, but if
 * {@link Buffer#ensureWritable(int)} is called on the composed buffer, and the composed buffer needs to be
 * expanded, then this allocator instance will be used for allocation the extra memory.
 *
 * <h3>Ownership and Send</h3>
 *
 * {@linkplain Resource#send() Sending} a composite buffer implies sending all of its constituent buffers.
 * For sending to be possible, both the composite buffer itself, and all of its constituent buffers, must be in a
 * state that permits them being sent. This should be the case by default, as it shouldn't be possible to create
 * composite buffers that can't be sent.
