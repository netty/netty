package java.lang.invoke;

/**
 * A stub for the VarHandle class.<br>
 * This stub is used to allow Java 8 release compilation to work as expected.
 * The sole limit of this stub is that since {@code java.lang.invoke} is a privileged package
 * it cannot be used at runtime (e.g. loaded by a classloader).<p>
 * For example, if {@code SomeClass} is loaded at runtime:
 * <pre>
 *     class SomeClass {
 *          private static final VarHandle VH = // ... obtained somehow;
 *
 *          public static void storeStoreFence() {
 *              if (VH == null) {
 *                  return;
 *              }
 *              VH.storeStoreFence();
 *          }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * this is not going to work on Java 8.<p>
 * To fix it is possible to use an holder class (which won't be loaded at runtime):
 * <pre>
 *     class SomeClass {
 *          static class Holder {
 *              private static final VarHandle VH = // ... obtained somehow;
 *          }
 *
 *          public static void storeStoreFence() {
 *              VarHandle vh = Holder.VH;
 *              if (vh == null) {
 *                  return;
 *              }
 *              vh.storeStoreFence();
 *          }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * Or:
 * <pre>
 *     class SomeClass {
 *          private static final Object VH = // ... obtained somehow;
 *
 *          public static void storeStoreFence() {
 *              if (VH == null) {
 *                  return;
 *              }
 *              ((VarHandle)VH).storeStoreFence();
 *          }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The reason why the methods on the stub are declared as native is to allow
 * {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle.PolymorphicSignature} to work as expected,
 * see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se9/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.3">JLS 15.12.3</a>:<br>
 * <pre>
 *   A method is signature polymorphic if all of the following are true:
 *   - It is declared in the java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle class or the java.lang.invoke.VarHandle class.
 *   - It has a single variable arity parameter (ยง8.4.1) whose declared type is Object[].
 *   - It is native.
 * </pre>
 * This seems counter-intuitive since this stub is not going to be used at runtime, but it is required to allow Java 8
 * compilation to produce {@code VarHandle}'s method invocations with parameters and result types with
 * the types of the formal ones of the compile-time declaration.
