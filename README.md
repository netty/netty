## How to build

For the detailed information about building and developing Netty, please visit [the developer guide](https://netty.io/wiki/developer-guide.html).  This page only gives very basic information.

You require the following to build Netty:

* Latest stable [OpenJDK 8](https://adoptium.net/)
* Latest stable [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* If you are on Linux or MacOS, you need [additional development packages](https://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html) installed on your system, because you'll build the native transport.

Note that this is build-time requirement.  JDK 5 (for 3.x) or 6 (for 4.0+ / 4.1+) is enough to run your Netty-based application.

## Branches to look

Development of all versions takes place in each branch whose name is identical to `<majorVersion>.<minorVersion>`.  For example, the development of 3.9 and 4.1 resides in [the branch '3.9'](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/3.9) and [the branch '4.1'](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/4.1) respectively.

## Usage with JDK 9+

You can read the [Modular Netty guide](testsuite-jpms/README.md) to learn more about using Netty with the Java Platform Module System, the guide 
contains a user section and a developer section for Netty contributors.
