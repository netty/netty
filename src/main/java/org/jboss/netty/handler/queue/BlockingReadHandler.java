/**
 * Emulates blocking read operation.  This handler stores all received messages
 * into a {@link BlockingQueue} and returns the received messages when
 * {@link #read()}, {@link #read(long, TimeUnit)}, {@link #readEvent()}, or
 * {@link #readEvent(long, TimeUnit)} method is called.
 * <p>
 * Please note that this handler is only useful for the cases where there are
 * very small number of connections, such as testing and simple client-side
 * application development.
 * <p>
 * Also, any handler placed after this handler will never receive
 * {@code messageReceived}, {@code exceptionCaught}, and {@code channelClosed}
 * events, hence it should be placed in the last place in a pipeline.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example that demonstrates the usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@link BlockingReadHandler}&lt;{@link ChannelBuffer}&gt; reader =
 *         new {@link BlockingReadHandler}&lt;{@link ChannelBuffer}&gt;();
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} p = ...;
 * p.addLast("reader", reader);
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Read a message from a channel in a blocking manner.
 * try {
 *     {@link ChannelBuffer} buf = reader.read(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 *     if (buf == null) {
 *         // Connection closed.
 *     } else {
 *         // Handle the received message here.
 *     }
 * } catch ({@link BlockingReadTimeoutException} e) {
 *     // Read timed out.
 * } catch (IOException e) {
 *     // Other read errors
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <E> the type of the received messages
