/**
 * A {@link MemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor} which makes sure the events from the
 * same {@link Channel} are executed sequentially.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE</b>: This thread pool inherits most characteristics of its super
 * type, so please make sure to refer to {@link MemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor}
 * to understand how it works basically.
 *
 * <h3>Event execution order</h3>
 *
 * For example, let's say there are two executor threads that handle the events
 * from the two channels:
 * <pre>
 *           -------------------------------------&gt; Timeline ------------------------------------&gt;
 *
 * Thread X: --- Channel A (Event A1) --.   .-- Channel B (Event B2) --- Channel B (Event B3) ---&gt;
 *                                      \ /
 *                                       X
 *                                      / \
 * Thread Y: --- Channel B (Event B1) --'   '-- Channel A (Event A2) --- Channel A (Event A3) ---&gt;
 * </pre>
 * As you see, the events from different channels are independent from each
 * other.  That is, an event of Channel B will not be blocked by an event of
 * Channel A and vice versa, unless the thread pool is exhausted.
 * <p>
 * Also, it is guaranteed that the invocation will be made sequentially for the
 * events from the same channel.  For example, the event A2 is never executed
 * before the event A1 is finished.  (Although not recommended, if you want the
 * events from the same channel to be executed simultaneously, please use
 * {@link MemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor} instead.)
 * <p>
 * However, it is not guaranteed that the invocation will be made by the same
 * thread for the same channel.  The events from the same channel can be
 * executed by different threads.  For example, the Event A2 is executed by the
 * thread Y while the event A1 was executed by the thread X.
 *
 * <h3>Using a different key other than {@link Channel} to maintain event order</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor} uses a {@link Channel} as a key
 * that is used for maintaining the event execution order, as explained in the
 * previous section.  Alternatively, you can extend it to change its behavior.
 * For example, you can change the key to the remote IP of the peer:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class RemoteAddressBasedOMATPE extends {@link OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor} {
 *
 *     ... Constructors ...
 *
 *     {@code @Override}
 *     protected ConcurrentMap&lt;Object, Executor&gt; newChildExecutorMap() {
 *         // The default implementation returns a special ConcurrentMap that
 *         // uses identity comparison only (see {@link IdentityHashMap}).
 *         // Because SocketAddress does not work with identity comparison,
 *         // we need to employ more generic implementation.
 *         return new ConcurrentHashMap&lt;Object, Executor&gt;
 *     }
 *
 *     protected Object getChildExecutorKey({@link ChannelEvent} e) {
 *         // Use the IP of the remote peer as a key.
 *         return ((InetSocketAddress) e.getChannel().getRemoteAddress()).getAddress();
 *     }
 *
 *     // Make public so that you can call from anywhere.
 *     public boolean removeChildExecutor(Object key) {
 *         super.removeChildExecutor(key);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Please be very careful of memory leak of the child executor map.  You must
 * call {@link #removeChildExecutor(Object)} when the life cycle of the key
 * ends (e.g. all connections from the same IP were closed.)  Also, please
 * keep in mind that the key can appear again after calling {@link #removeChildExecutor(Object)}
 * (e.g. a new connection could come in from the same old IP after removal.)
 * If in doubt, prune the old unused or stall keys from the child executor map
 * periodically:
 *
 * <pre>
 * RemoteAddressBasedOMATPE executor = ...;
 *
 * on every 3 seconds:
 *
 *   for (Iterator&lt;Object&gt; i = executor.getChildExecutorKeySet().iterator; i.hasNext();) {
 *       InetAddress ip = (InetAddress) i.next();
 *       if (there is no active connection from 'ip' now &&
 *           there has been no incoming connection from 'ip' for last 10 minutes) {
 *           i.remove();
 *       }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the expected maximum number of keys is small and deterministic, you could
 * use a weak key map such as <a href="http://viewvc.jboss.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/jbosscache/experimental/jsr166/src/jsr166y/ConcurrentWeakHashMap.java?view=markup">ConcurrentWeakHashMap</a>
 * or synchronized {@link WeakHashMap} instead of managing the life cycle of the
 * keys by yourself.
