/**
 * A helper class which creates a new client-side {@link Channel} and makes a
 * connection attempt.
 *
 * <h3>Configuring a channel</h3>
 *
 * {@link #setOption(String, Object) Options} are used to configure a channel:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@link ClientBootstrap} b = ...;
 *
 * // Options for a new channel
 * b.setOption("remoteAddress", new {@link InetSocketAddress}("example.com", 8080));
 * b.setOption("tcpNoDelay", true);
 * b.setOption("receiveBufferSize", 1048576);
 * </pre>
 *
 * For the detailed list of available options, please refer to
 * {@link ChannelConfig} and its sub-types.
 *
 * <h3>Configuring a channel pipeline</h3>
 *
 * Every channel has its own {@link ChannelPipeline} and you can configure it
 * in two ways.
 *
 * The recommended approach is to specify a {@link ChannelPipelineFactory} by
 * calling {@link #setPipelineFactory(ChannelPipelineFactory)}.
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@link ClientBootstrap} b = ...;
 * b.setPipelineFactory(new MyPipelineFactory());
 *
 * public class MyPipelineFactory implements {@link ChannelPipelineFactory} {
 *   public {@link ChannelPipeline} getPipeline() throws Exception {
 *     // Create and configure a new pipeline for a new channel.
 *     {@link ChannelPipeline} p = {@link Channels}.pipeline();
 *     p.addLast("encoder", new EncodingHandler());
 *     p.addLast("decoder", new DecodingHandler());
 *     p.addLast("logic",   new LogicHandler());
 *     return p;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>

 * <p>
 * The alternative approach, which works only in a certain situation, is to use
 * the default pipeline and let the bootstrap to shallow-copy the default
 * pipeline for each new channel:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@link ClientBootstrap} b = ...;
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} p = b.getPipeline();
 *
 * // Add handlers to the default pipeline.
 * p.addLast("encoder", new EncodingHandler());
 * p.addLast("decoder", new DecodingHandler());
 * p.addLast("logic",   new LogicHandler());
 * </pre>
 *
 * Please note 'shallow-copy' here means that the added {@link ChannelHandler}s
 * are not cloned but only their references are added to the new pipeline.
 * Therefore, you cannot use this approach if you are going to open more than
 * one {@link Channel}s or run a server that accepts incoming connections to
 * create its child channels.
 *
 * <h3>Applying different settings for different {@link Channel}s</h3>
 *
 * {@link ClientBootstrap} is just a helper class.  It neither allocates nor
 * manages any resources.  What manages the resources is the
 * {@link ChannelFactory} implementation you specified in the constructor of
 * {@link ClientBootstrap}.  Therefore, it is OK to create as many
 * {@link ClientBootstrap} instances as you want with the same
 * {@link ChannelFactory} to apply different settings for different
 * {@link Channel}s.
