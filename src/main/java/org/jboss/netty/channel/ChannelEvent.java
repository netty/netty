/**
 * An I/O event or I/O request associated with a {@link Channel}.
 * <p>
 * A {@link ChannelEvent} is handled by a series of {@link ChannelHandler}s in
 * a {@link ChannelPipeline}.
 *
 * <h3>Upstream events and downstream events, and their interpretation</h3>
 * <p>
 * Every event is either an upstream event or a downstream event.
 * If an event flows forward from the first handler to the last handler in a
 * {@link ChannelPipeline}, we call it an upstream event and say <strong>"an
 * event goes upstream."</strong>  If an event flows backward from the last
 * handler to the first handler in a {@link ChannelPipeline}, we call it a
 * downstream event and say <strong>"an event goes downstream."</strong>
 * (Please refer to the diagram in {@link ChannelPipeline} for more explanation.)
 * <p>
 * When your server receives a message from a client, the event associated with
 * the received message is an upstream event.  When your server sends a message
 * or reply to the client, the event associated with the write request is a
 * downstream event.  The same rule applies for the client side.  If your client
 * sent a request to the server, it means your client triggered a downstream
 * event.  If your client received a response from the server, it means
 * your client will be notified with an upstream event.  Upstream events are
 * often the result of inbound operations such as {@link InputStream#read(byte[])},
 * and downstream events are the request for outbound operations such as
 * {@link OutputStream#write(byte[])}, {@link Socket#connect(SocketAddress)},
 * and {@link Socket#close()}.

 * <p>
 * Other event types and conditions which were not addressed here will be
 * ignored and discarded.  Please note that there's no {@code "open"} in the
 * table.  It is because a {@link Channel} is always open when it is created
 * by a {@link ChannelFactory}.
 *
 * <h3>Additional resources worth reading</h3>
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the {@link ChannelHandler} and {@link ChannelPipeline}
 * documentation to find out how an event flows in a pipeline and how to handle
 * the event in your application.
