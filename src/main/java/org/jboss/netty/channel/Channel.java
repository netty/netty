/**
 * A nexus to a network socket or a component which is capable of I/O
 * operations such as read, write, connect, and bind.
 * <p>
 * A channel provides a user:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the current state of the channel (e.g. is it open? is it connected?),</li>
 * <li>the {@linkplain ChannelConfig configuration parameters} of the channel (e.g. receive buffer size),</li>
 * <li>the I/O operations that the channel supports (e.g. read, write, connect, and bind), and</li>
 * <li>the {@link ChannelPipeline} which handles all {@linkplain ChannelEvent I/O events and requests}
 *     associated with the channel.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>All I/O operations are asynchronous.</h3>
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will
 * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has
 * been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which will notify you when the requested I/O
 * operation has succeeded, failed, or canceled.
 *
 * <h3>Channels are hierarchical</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Channel} can have a {@linkplain #getParent() parent} depending on
 * how it was created.  For instance, a {@link SocketChannel}, that was accepted
 * by {@link ServerSocketChannel}, will return the {@link ServerSocketChannel}
 * as its parent on {@link #getParent()}.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of the hierarchical structure depends on the transport
 * implementation where the {@link Channel} belongs to.  For example, you could
 * write a new {@link Channel} implementation that creates the sub-channels that
 * share one socket connection, as <a href="http://beepcore.org/">BEEP</a> and
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> do.
 *
 * <h3>Downcast to access transport-specific operations</h3>
 * <p>
 * Some transports exposes additional operations that is specific to the
 * transport.  Down-cast the {@link Channel} to sub-type to invoke such
 * operations.  For example, with the old I/O datagram transport, multicast
 * join / leave operations are provided by {@link DatagramChannel}.
 *
 * <h3>InterestOps</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Channel} has a property called {@link #getInterestOps() interestOps}
 * which is similar to that of {@link SelectionKey#interestOps() NIO SelectionKey}.
 * It is represented as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field">bit
 * field</a> which is composed of the two flags.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #OP_READ} - If set, a message sent by a remote peer will be read
 *     immediately.  If unset, the message from the remote peer will not be read
 *     until the {@link #OP_READ} flag is set again (i.e. read suspension).</li>
 * <li>{@link #OP_WRITE} - If set, a write request will not be sent to a remote
 *     peer until the {@link #OP_WRITE} flag is cleared and the write request
 *     will be pending in a queue.  If unset, the write request will be flushed
 *     out as soon as possible from the queue.</li>
 * <li>{@link #OP_READ_WRITE} - This is a combination of {@link #OP_READ} and
 *     {@link #OP_WRITE}, which means only write requests are suspended.</li>
 * <li>{@link #OP_NONE} - This is a combination of (NOT {@link #OP_READ}) and
 *     (NOT {@link #OP_WRITE}), which means only read operation is suspended.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p><p>
 * You can set or clear the {@link #OP_READ} flag to suspend and resume read
 * operation via {@link #setReadable(boolean)}.
 * </p><p>
 * Please note that you cannot suspend or resume write operation just like you
 * can set or clear {@link #OP_READ}. The {@link #OP_WRITE} flag is read only
 * and provided simply as a mean to tell you if the size of pending write
 * requests exceeded a certain threshold or not so that you don't issue too many
 * pending writes that lead to an {@link OutOfMemoryError}.  For example, the
 * NIO socket transport uses the {@code writeBufferLowWaterMark} and
 * {@code writeBufferHighWaterMark} properties in {@link NioSocketChannelConfig}
 * to determine when to set or clear the {@link #OP_WRITE} flag.
