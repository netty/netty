/**
 * The result of an asynchronous {@link ChannelGroup} operation.
 * {@link ChannelGroupFuture} is composed of {@link ChannelFuture}s which
 * represent the outcome of the individual I/O operations that affect the
 * {@link Channel}s in the {@link ChannelGroup}.
 *
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in {@link ChannelGroup} are asynchronous.  It means any
 * I/O calls will return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O
 * operations have been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be
 * returned with a {@link ChannelGroupFuture} instance which tells you when the
 * requested I/O operations have succeeded, failed, or cancelled.
 * <p>
 * Various methods are provided to let you check if the I/O operations has been
 * completed, wait for the completion, and retrieve the result of the I/O
 * operation. It also allows you to add more than one
 * {@link ChannelGroupFutureListener} so you can get notified when the I/O
 * operation have been completed.
 *
 * <h3>Prefer {@link #addListener(ChannelGroupFutureListener)} to {@link #await()}</h3>
 *
 * It is recommended to prefer {@link #addListener(ChannelGroupFutureListener)} to
 * {@link #await()} wherever possible to get notified when I/O operations are
 * done and to do any follow-up tasks.
 * <p>
 * {@link #addListener(ChannelGroupFutureListener)} is non-blocking.  It simply
 * adds the specified {@link ChannelGroupFutureListener} to the
 * {@link ChannelGroupFuture}, and I/O thread will notify the listeners when
 * the I/O operations associated with the future is done.
 * {@link ChannelGroupFutureListener} yields the best performance and resource
 * utilization because it does not block at all, but it could be tricky to
 * implement a sequential logic if you are not used to event-driven programming.
 * <p>
 * By contrast, {@link #await()} is a blocking operation.  Once called, the
 * caller thread blocks until all I/O operations are done.  It is easier to
 * implement a sequential logic with {@link #await()}, but the caller thread
 * blocks unnecessarily until all I/O operations are done and there's relatively
 * expensive cost of inter-thread notification.  Moreover, there's a chance of
 * dead lock in a particular circumstance, which is described below.
 *
 * <h3>Do not call {@link #await()} inside {@link ChannelHandler}</h3>
 * <p>
 * The event handler methods in {@link ChannelHandler} is often called by
 * an I/O thread unless an {@link ExecutionHandler} is in the
 * {@link ChannelPipeline}.  If {@link #await()} is called by an event handler
 * method, which is called by the I/O thread, the I/O operation it is waiting
 * for might never be complete because {@link #await()} can block the I/O
 * operation it is waiting for, which is a dead lock.
 * <pre>
 * // BAD - NEVER DO THIS
 * {@code @Override}
 * public void messageReceived({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx, {@link MessageEvent} e) {
 *     if (e.getMessage() instanceof ShutdownMessage) {
 *         {@link ChannelGroup} allChannels = MyServer.getAllChannels();
 *         {@link ChannelGroupFuture} future = allChannels.close();
 *         future.awaitUninterruptibly();
 *         // Perform post-shutdown operation
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // GOOD
 * {@code @Override}
 * public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e) {
 *     if (e.getMessage() instanceof ShutdownMessage) {
 *         {@link ChannelGroup} allChannels = MyServer.getAllChannels();
 *         {@link ChannelGroupFuture} future = allChannels.close();
 *         future.addListener(new {@link ChannelGroupFutureListener}() {
 *             public void operationComplete({@link ChannelGroupFuture} future) {
 *                 // Perform post-closure operation
 *                 // ...
 *             }
 *         });
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In spite of the disadvantages mentioned above, there are certainly the cases
 * where it is more convenient to call {@link #await()}. In such a case, please
 * make sure you do not call {@link #await()} in an I/O thread.  Otherwise,
 * {@link IllegalStateException} will be raised to prevent a dead lock.
