/**
 * Handles or intercepts a {@link ChannelEvent}, and sends a
 * {@link ChannelEvent} to the next handler in a {@link ChannelPipeline}.
 *
 * <h3>Sub-types</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link ChannelHandler} itself does not provide any method.  To handle a
 * {@link ChannelEvent} you need to implement its sub-interfaces.  There are
 * two sub-interfaces which handles a received event, one for upstream events
 * and the other for downstream events:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ChannelUpstreamHandler} handles and intercepts an upstream {@link ChannelEvent}.</li>
 * <li>{@link ChannelDownstreamHandler} handles and intercepts a downstream {@link ChannelEvent}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * You will also find more detailed explanation from the documentation of
 * each sub-interface on how an event is interpreted when it goes upstream and
 * downstream respectively.
 *
 * <h3>The context object</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link ChannelHandler} is provided with a {@link ChannelHandlerContext}
 * object.  A {@link ChannelHandler} is supposed to interact with the
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} it belongs to via a context object.  Using the
 * context object, the {@link ChannelHandler} can pass events upstream or
 * downstream, modify the behavior of the pipeline, or store the information
 * (attachment) which is specific to the handler.
 *
 * <h3>Additional resources worth reading</h3>
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the {@link ChannelEvent} and {@link ChannelPipeline} to find
 * out what a upstream event and a downstream event are, what fundamental
 * differences they have, and how they flow in a pipeline.
