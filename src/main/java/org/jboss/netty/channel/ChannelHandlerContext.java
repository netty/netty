/**
 * Enables a {@link ChannelHandler} to interact with its {@link ChannelPipeline}
 * and other handlers.  A handler can send a {@link ChannelEvent} upstream or
 * downstream, modify the {@link ChannelPipeline} it belongs to dynamically.
 *
 * <h3>Sending an event</h3>
 *
 * You can send or forward a {@link ChannelEvent} to the closest handler in the
 * same {@link ChannelPipeline} by calling {@link #sendUpstream(ChannelEvent)}
 * or {@link #sendDownstream(ChannelEvent)}.  Please refer to
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} to understand how an event flows.
 *
 * <h3>Modifying a pipeline</h3>
 *
 * You can get the {@link ChannelPipeline} your handler belongs to by calling
 * {@link #getPipeline()}.  A non-trivial application could insert, remove, or
 * replace handlers in the pipeline dynamically in runtime.
 *
 * <h3>Retrieving for later use</h3>
 *
 * You can keep the {@link ChannelHandlerContext} for later use, such as
 * triggering an event outside the handler methods, even from a different thread.
 * <pre>
 * public class MyHandler extends {@link SimpleChannelHandler}
 *                        implements {@link LifeCycleAwareChannelHandler} {
 *
 *     <b>private {@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx;</b>
 *
 *     public void beforeAdd({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx) {
 *         <b>this.ctx = ctx;</b>
 *     }
 *
 *     public void login(String username, password) {
 *         {@link Channels}.write(
 *                 <b>this.ctx</b>,
 *                 {@link Channels}.succeededFuture(<b>this.ctx</t>.getChannel()),
 *                 new LoginMessage(username, password));
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Storing stateful information</h3>
 *
 * {@link #setAttachment(Object)} and {@link #getAttachment()} allow you to
 * store and access stateful information that is related with a handler and its
 * context.  Please refer to {@link ChannelHandler} to learn various recommended
 * ways to manage stateful information.
 *
 * <h3>A handler can have more than one context</h3>
 *
 * Please note that a {@link ChannelHandler} instance can be added to more than
 * one {@link ChannelPipeline}.  It means a single {@link ChannelHandler}
 * instance can have more than one {@link ChannelHandlerContext} and therefore
 * the single instance can be invoked with different
 * {@link ChannelHandlerContext}s if it is added to one or more
 * {@link ChannelPipeline}s more than once.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following handler will have as many independent attachments
 * as how many times it is added to pipelines, regardless if it is added to the
 * same pipeline multiple times or added to different pipelines multiple times:
 * <pre>
 * public class FactorialHandler extends {@link SimpleChannelHandler} {
 *
 *   // This handler will receive a sequence of increasing integers starting
 *   // from 1.
 *   {@code @Override}
 *   public void messageReceived({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx, {@link MessageEvent} evt) {
 *     Integer a = (Integer) ctx.getAttachment();
 *     Integer b = (Integer) evt.getMessage();
 *
 *     if (a == null) {
 *       a = 1;
 *     }
 *
 *     ctx.setAttachment(Integer.valueOf(a * b));
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Different context objects are given to "f1", "f2", "f3", and "f4" even if
 * // they refer to the same handler instance.  Because the FactorialHandler
 * // stores its state in a context object (as an attachment), the factorial is
 * // calculated correctly 4 times once the two pipelines (p1 and p2) are active.
 * FactorialHandler fh = new FactorialHandler();
 *
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} p1 = {@link Channels}.pipeline();
 * p1.addLast("f1", fh);
 * p1.addLast("f2", fh);
 *
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} p2 = {@link Channels}.pipeline();
 * p2.addLast("f3", fh);
 * p2.addLast("f4", fh);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Additional resources worth reading</h3>
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the {@link ChannelHandler}, {@link ChannelEvent}, and
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} to find out what a upstream event and a downstream
 * event are, what fundamental differences they have, how they flow in a
 * pipeline,  and how to handle the event in your application.
