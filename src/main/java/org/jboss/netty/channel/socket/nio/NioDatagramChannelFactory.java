/**
 * A {@link NioDatagramChannelFactory} creates a server-side NIO-based
 * {@link  NioDatagramChannel}. It utilizes the non-blocking I/O mode which
 * was introduced with NIO to serve many number of concurrent connections
 * efficiently.
 * 
 * <h3>How threads work</h3>
 * <p>
 * There is only one type of thread in a {@link NioDatagramChannelFactory},
 * as opposed to the {@link NioServerSocketChannelFactory} where there is one boss 
 * thread and a worker thread.
 * The boss thread in {@link NioServerSocketChannelFactory} performs the accept of
 * incoming connection and then passes the accepted Channel to on of the worker 
 * threads. As DatagramChannels can act as both server (listener) and client (sender)
 * hence there is no concept of ServerSocketChannel and SocketChannel whic means that 
 * there nothing to accept accept. This is the reason that there is only worker theads.
 * 
 * <h4>Worker threads</h4>
 * <p>
 * One {@link NioDatagramChannelFactory} can have one or more worker
 * threads.  A worker thread performs non-blocking read and write for one or
 * more {@link Channel}s in a non-blocking mode.
