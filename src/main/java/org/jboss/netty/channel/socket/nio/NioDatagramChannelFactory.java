/**
 * A {@link DatagramChannelFactory} that creates a NIO-based connectionless
 * {@link DatagramChannel}. It utilizes the non-blocking I/O mode which
 * was introduced with NIO to serve many number of concurrent connections
 * efficiently.
 *
 * <h3>How threads work</h3>
 * <p>
 * There is only one thread type in a {@link NioDatagramChannelFactory};
 * worker threads.
 *
 * <h4>Worker threads</h4>
 * <p>
 * One {@link NioDatagramChannelFactory} can have one or more worker
 * threads.  A worker thread performs non-blocking read and write for one or
 * more {@link DatagramChannel}s in a non-blocking mode.
 *
 * <h3>Life cycle of threads and graceful shutdown</h3>
 * <p>
 * All worker threads are acquired from the {@link Executor} which was specified
 * when a {@link NioDatagramChannelFactory} was created.  Therefore, you should
 * make sure the specified {@link Executor} is able to lend the sufficient
 * number of threads.  It is the best bet to specify
 * {@linkplain Executors#newCachedThreadPool() a cached thread pool}.
 * <p>
 * All worker threads are acquired lazily, and then released when there's
 * nothing left to process.  All the related resources such as {@link Selector}
 * are also released when the worker threads are released.  Therefore, to shut
 * down a service gracefully, you should do the following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>close all channels created by the factory usually using
 *     {@link ChannelGroup#close()}, and</li>
 * <li>call {@link #releaseExternalResources()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Please make sure not to shut down the executor until all channels are
 * closed.  Otherwise, you will end up with a {@link RejectedExecutionException}
 * and the related resources might not be released properly.
 *
 * <h3>Limitation</h3>
 * <p>
 * Multicast is not supported.  Please use {@link OioDatagramChannelFactory}
 * instead.
