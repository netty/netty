/**
 * A {@link ServerSocketChannelFactory} which creates a server-side NIO-based
 * {@link ServerSocketChannel}.  It utilizes the non-blocking I/O mode which
 * was introduced with NIO to serve many number of concurrent connections
 * efficiently.
 *
 * <h3>How threads work</h3>
 * <p>
 * There are two types of threads in a {@link NioServerSocketChannelFactory};
 * one is boss thread and the other is worker thread.
 *
 * <h4>Boss threads</h4>
 * <p>
 * Each bound {@link ServerSocketChannel} has its own boss thread.
 * For example, if you opened two server ports such as 80 and 443, you will
 * have two boss threads.  A boss thread accepts incoming connections until
 * the port is unbound.  Once a connection is accepted successfully, the boss
 * thread passes the accepted {@link Channel} to one of the worker
 * threads that the {@link NioServerSocketChannelFactory} manages.
 *
 * <h4>Worker threads</h4>
 * <p>
 * One {@link NioServerSocketChannelFactory} can have one or more worker
 * threads.  A worker thread performs non-blocking read and write for one or
 * more {@link Channel}s in a non-blocking mode.
 *
 * <h3>Life cycle of threads and graceful shutdown</h3>
 * <p>
 * All threads are acquired from the {@link Executor}s which were specified
 * when a {@link NioServerSocketChannelFactory} was created.  Boss threads are
 * acquired from the {@code bossExecutor}, and worker threads are acquired from
 * the {@code workerExecutor}.  Therefore, you should make sure the specified
 * {@link Executor}s are able to lend the sufficient number of threads.
 * It is the best bet to specify {@linkplain Executors#newCachedThreadPool() a cached thread pool}.
 * <p>
 * Both boss and worker threads are acquired lazily, and then released when
 * there's nothing left to process.  All the related resources such as
 * {@link Selector} are also released when the boss and worker threads are
 * released.  Therefore, to shut down a service gracefully, you should do the
 * following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>unbind all channels created by the factory,
 * <li>close all child channels accepted by the unbound channels, and
 *     (these two steps so far is usually done using {@link ChannelGroup#close()})</li>
 * <li>call {@link #releaseExternalResources()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Please make sure not to shut down the executor until all channels are
 * closed.  Otherwise, you will end up with a {@link RejectedExecutionException}
 * and the related resources might not be released properly.
