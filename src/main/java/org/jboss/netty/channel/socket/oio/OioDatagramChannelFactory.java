/**
 * A {@link DatagramChannelFactory} which creates a blocking I/O based
 * {@link DatagramChannel}.  It utilizes the good old blocking I/O API which
 * has support for multicast.
 *
 * <h3>How threads work</h3>
 * <p>
 * There is only one type of threads in {@link OioDatagramChannelFactory};
 * worker threads.
 *
 * <h4>Worker threads</h4>
 * <p>
 * Each {@link Channel} has a dedicated worker thread, just like a
 * traditional blocking I/O thread model.
 *
 * <h3>Life cycle of threads and graceful shutdown</h3>
 * <p>
 * Worker threads are acquired from the {@link Executor} which was specified
 * when a {@link OioDatagramChannelFactory} was created (i.e. {@code workerExecutor}.)
 * Therefore, you should make sure the specified {@link Executor} is able to
 * lend the sufficient number of threads.
 * <p>
 * Worker threads are acquired lazily, and then released when there's nothing
 * left to process.  All the related resources are also released when the
 * worker threads are released.  Therefore, to shut down a service gracefully,
 * you should do the following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>close all channels created by the factory usually using
 *     {@link ChannelGroup#close()}, and</li>
 * <li>call {@link #releaseExternalResources()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Please make sure not to shut down the executor until all channels are
 * closed.  Otherwise, you will end up with a {@link RejectedExecutionException}
 * and the related resources might not be released properly.
 *
 * <h3>Limitation</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link DatagramChannel} created by this factory does not support asynchronous
 * operations.  Any I/O requests such as {@code "write"} will be performed in a
 * blocking manner.
