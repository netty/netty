/**
 * A {@link ServerSocketChannelFactory} which creates a server-side blocking
 * I/O based {@link ServerSocketChannel}.  It utilizes the good old blocking
 * I/O API which is known to yield better throughput and latency when there
 * are relatively small number of connections to serve.
 *
 * <h3>How threads work</h3>
 * <p>
 * There are two types of threads in a {@link OioServerSocketChannelFactory};
 * one is boss thread and the other is worker thread.
 *
 * <h4>Boss threads</h4>
 * <p>
 * Each bound {@link ServerSocketChannel} has its own boss thread.
 * For example, if you opened two server ports such as 80 and 443, you will
 * have two boss threads.  A boss thread accepts incoming connections until
 * the port is unbound.  Once a connection is accepted successfully, the boss
 * thread passes the accepted {@link Channel} to one of the worker
 * threads that the {@link OioServerSocketChannelFactory} manages.
 *
 * <h4>Worker threads</h4>
 * <p>
 * Each connected {@link Channel} has a dedicated worker thread, just like a
 * traditional blocking I/O thread model.
 *
 * <h3>Life cycle of threads and graceful shutdown</h3>
 * <p>
 * All threads are acquired from the {@link Executor}s which were specified
 * when a {@link OioServerSocketChannelFactory} was created.  Boss threads are
 * acquired from the {@code bossExecutor}, and worker threads are acquired from
 * the {@code workerExecutor}.  Therefore, you should make sure the specified
 * {@link Executor}s are able to lend the sufficient number of threads.
 * <p>
 * Both boss and worker threads are acquired lazily, and then released when
 * there's nothing left to process.  All the related resources are also
 * released when the boss and worker threads are released.  Therefore, to shut
 * down a service gracefully, you should do the following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>unbind all channels created by the factory,
 * <li>close all child channels accepted by the unbound channels,
 *     (these two steps so far is usually done using {@link ChannelGroup#close()})</li>
 * <li>call {@link #releaseExternalResources()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Please make sure not to shut down the executor until all channels are
 * closed.  Otherwise, you will end up with a {@link RejectedExecutionException}
 * and the related resources might not be released properly.
 *
 * <h3>Limitation</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link ServerSocketChannel} created by this factory and its child channels
 * do not support asynchronous operations.  Any I/O requests such as
 * {@code "write"} will be performed in a blocking manner.
