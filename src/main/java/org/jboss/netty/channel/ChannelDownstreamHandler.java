/**
 * Handles or intercepts a downstream {@link ChannelEvent}, and sends a
 * {@link ChannelEvent} to the next handler in a {@link ChannelPipeline}.
 * <p>
 * The most common use case of this interface is to intercept an I/O request
 * such as {@link Channel#write(Object)} and {@link Channel#close()}.
 *
 * <h3>{@link SimpleChannelDownstreamHandler}</h3>
 * <p>
 * In most cases, you will get to use a {@link SimpleChannelDownstreamHandler}
 * to implement a downstream handler because it provides an individual handler
 * method for each event type.  You might want to implement this interface
 * directly though if you want to handle various types of events in more
 * generic way.
 *
 * <h3>Firing an event to the next handler</h3>
 * <p>
 * You can forward the received event downstream or upstream.  In most cases,
 * {@link ChannelDownstreamHandler} will send the event downstream
 * (i.e. outbound) although it is legal to send the event upstream (i.e. inbound):
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Sending the event downstream (outbound)
 * void handleDownstream({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx, {@link ChannelEvent} e) throws Exception {
 *     ...
 *     ctx.sendDownstream(e);
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * // Sending the event upstream (inbound)
 * void handleDownstream({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx, {@link ChannelEvent} e) throws Exception {
 *     ...
 *     ctx.sendUpstream(new DefaultChannelStateEvent(...));
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Using the helper class to send an event</h4>
 * <p>
 * You will also find various helper methods in {@link Channels} to be useful
 * to generate and send an artificial or manipulated event.
 *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link #handleDownstream(ChannelHandlerContext, ChannelEvent) handleDownstream}
 * may be invoked by more than one thread simultaneously.  If the handler
 * accesses a shared resource or stores stateful information, you might need
 * proper synchronization in the handler implementation.
 * <p>
 * Also, please refer to the {@link ChannelPipelineCoverage} annotation to
 * understand the relationship between a handler and its stateful properties.
