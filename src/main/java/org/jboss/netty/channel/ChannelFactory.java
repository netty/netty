/**
 * The main interface to a transport that creates a {@link Channel} associated
 * with a certain communication entity such as a network socket.  For example,
 * the {@link NioServerSocketChannelFactory} creates a channel which has a
 * NIO-based server socket as its underlying communication entity.
 * <p>
 * Once a new {@link Channel} is created, the {@link ChannelPipeline} which
 * was specified as a parameter in the {@link #newChannel(ChannelPipeline)}
 * is attached to the new {@link Channel}, and starts to handle all associated
 * {@link ChannelEvent}s.
 *
 * <h3>Graceful shutdown</h3>
 * <p>
 * To shut down a network application service which is managed by a factory.
 * you should follow the following steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>close all channels created by the factory and their child channels
 *     usually using {@link ChannelGroup#close()}, and</li>
 * <li>call {@link #releaseExternalResources()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * For detailed transport-specific information on shutting down a factory,
 * please refer to the Javadoc of {@link ChannelFactory}'s subtypes, such as
 * {@link NioServerSocketChannelFactory}.
