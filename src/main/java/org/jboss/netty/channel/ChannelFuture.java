/**
 * The result of an asynchronous {@link Channel} I/O operation.
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will
 * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has
 * been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which gives you the information about the
 * result or status of the I/O operation.
 * <p>
 * A {@link ChannelFuture} is either <em>uncompleted</em> or <em>completed</em>.
 * When an I/O operation begins, a new future object is created.  The new future
 * is uncompleted initially - it is neither succeeded, failed, nor cancelled
 * because the I/O operation is not finished yet.  If the I/O operation is
 * finished either successfully, with failure, or by cancellation, the future is
 * marked as completed with more specific information, such as the cause of the
 * failure.  Please note that even failure and cancellation belong to the
 * completed state.
 * <pre>

 *                                      | Completed successfully    |

 *
 * Various methods are provided to let you check if the I/O operation has been
 * completed, wait for the completion, and retrieve the result of the I/O
 * operation. It also allows you to add {@link ChannelFutureListener}s so you
 * can get notified when the I/O operation is completed.
 *
 * <h3>Prefer {@link #addListener(ChannelFutureListener)} to {@link #await()}</h3>
 *
 * It is recommended to prefer {@link #addListener(ChannelFutureListener)} to
 * {@link #await()} wherever possible to get notified when an I/O operation is
 * done and to do any follow-up tasks.
 * <p>
 * {@link #addListener(ChannelFutureListener)} is non-blocking.  It simply adds
 * the specified {@link ChannelFutureListener} to the {@link ChannelFuture}, and
 * I/O thread will notify the listeners when the I/O operation associated with
 * the future is done.  {@link ChannelFutureListener} yields the best
 * performance and resource utilization because it does not block at all, but
 * it could be tricky to implement a sequential logic if you are not used to
 * event-driven programming.
 * <p>
 * By contrast, {@link #await()} is a blocking operation.  Once called, the
 * caller thread blocks until the operation is done.  It is easier to implement
 * a sequential logic with {@link #await()}, but the caller thread blocks
 * unnecessarily until the I/O operation is done and there's relatively
 * expensive cost of inter-thread notification.  Moreover, there's a chance of
 * dead lock in a particular circumstance, which is described below.
 *
 * <h3>Do not call {@link #await()} inside {@link ChannelHandler}</h3>
 * <p>
 * The event handler methods in {@link ChannelHandler} is often called by
 * an I/O thread unless an {@link ExecutionHandler} is in the
 * {@link ChannelPipeline}.  If {@link #await()} is called by an event handler
 * method, which is called by the I/O thread, the I/O operation it is waiting
 * for might never be complete because {@link #await()} can block the I/O
 * operation it is waiting for, which is a dead lock.
 * <pre>
 * // BAD - NEVER DO THIS
 * {@code @Override}
 * public void messageReceived({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx, {@link MessageEvent} e) {
 *     if (e.getMessage() instanceof GoodByeMessage) {
 *         {@link ChannelFuture} future = e.getChannel().close();
 *         future.awaitUninterruptibly();
 *         // Perform post-closure operation
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // GOOD
 * {@code @Override}
 * public void messageReceived({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx, {@link MessageEvent} e) {
 *     if (e.getMessage() instanceof GoodByeMessage) {
 *         {@link ChannelFuture} future = e.getChannel().close();
 *         future.addListener(new {@link ChannelFutureListener}() {
 *             public void operationComplete({@link ChannelFuture} future) {
 *                 // Perform post-closure operation
 *                 // ...
 *             }
 *         });
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In spite of the disadvantages mentioned above, there are certainly the cases
 * where it is more convenient to call {@link #await()}. In such a case, please
 * make sure you do not call {@link #await()} in an I/O thread.  Otherwise,
 * {@link IllegalStateException} will be raised to prevent a dead lock.
 *
 * <h3>Do not confuse I/O timeout and await timeout</h3>
 *
 * The timeout value you specify with {@link #await(long)},
 * {@link #await(long, TimeUnit)}, {@link #awaitUninterruptibly(long)}, or
 * {@link #awaitUninterruptibly(long, TimeUnit)} are not related with I/O
 * timeout at all.  If an I/O operation times out, the future will be marked as
 * 'completed with failure,' as depicted in the diagram above.  For example,
 * connect timeout should be configured via a transport-specific option:
 * <pre>
 * // BAD - NEVER DO THIS
 * {@link ClientBootstrap} b = ...;
 * {@link ChannelFuture} f = b.connect(...);
 * f.awaitUninterruptibly(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 * if (f.isCancelled()) {
 *     // Connection attempt cancelled by user
 * } else if (!f.isSuccess()) {
 *     // You might get a NullPointerException here because the future
 *     // might not be completed yet.
 *     f.getCause().printStackTrace();
 * } else {
 *     // Connection established successfully
 * }
 *
 * // GOOD
 * {@link ClientBootstrap} b = ...;
 * // Configure the connect timeout option.
 * <b>b.setOption("connectTimeoutMillis", 10000);</b>
 * {@link ChannelFuture} f = b.connect(...);
 * f.awaitUninterruptibly();
 *
 * // Now we are sure the future is completed.
 * assert f.isDone();
 *
 * if (f.isCancelled()) {
 *     // Connection attempt cancelled by user
 * } else if (!f.isSuccess()) {
 *     f.getCause().printStackTrace();
 * } else {
 *     // Connection established successfully
 * }
 * </pre>
