    <title>Before Getting Started</title>
    <para>
      The minimum requirements to run the examples which are introduced in
      this chapter are only two; the latest version of Netty and JDK 1.5 or
      above.  The latest version of Netty is available in
      <ulink url="&Downloads;">the project download page</ulink>.  To download
      the right version of JDK, please refer to your preferred JDK vendor's web
      site.

    <title>Writing a Discard Server</title>
    <para>
      The most simplistic protocol in the world is not 'Hello, World!' but 
      <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc863">DISCARD</ulink>.  It's
      a protocol which discards any received data without any response.
    </para>
    <para>
      To implement the DISCARD protocol, the only thing you need to do is
      to ignore all received data.  Let us start straight from the handler
      implementation, which handles I/O events generated by Netty.

          handler methods that you can override.  For now, it is just enough
          to extend &SimpleChannelHandler; rather than to implement

          exception thrown while processing events.  In most cases, the
          caught exception should be logged and its associated channel
          should be closed here, although the implementation of this method
          can be different depending on what you want to do to deal with an
          exceptional situation.  For example, you might want to send a

          &ChannelFactory; is a factory which creates and manages &Channel;s
          and its related resources.  It processes all I/O requests and
          performs I/O to generate &ChannelEvent;s.  Netty provides various
          &ChannelFactory; implementations.  We are implementing a server-side
          application in this example, and therefore
          &NioServerSocketChannelFactory; was used.  Another thing to note is
          that it does not create I/O threads by itself.  It is supposed to
          acquire threads from the thread pool you specified in the
          constructor, and it gives you more control over how threads should
          be managed in the environment where your application runs, such as
          an application server with a security manager.

          &ServerBootstrap; is a helper class that sets up a server. You can
          set up the server using a &Channel; directly.  However, please note

          contains the <classname>DiscardServerHandler</classname>.  As the
          application gets complicated, it is likely that you will add more
          handlers to the pipeline and extract this anonymous class into a top

    <title>Looking into the Received Data</title>
    <para>
      Now that we have written our first server, we need to test if it really
      works.  The easiest way to test it is to use the <command>telnet</command>
      command.  For example, you could enter "<command>telnet localhost
      8080</command>" in the command line and type something.
    </para>
    <para>
      However, can we say that the server is working fine?  We cannot really
      know that because it is a discard server.  You will not get any response
      at all.  To prove it is really working, let us modify the server to print
      what it has received.
    </para>
    <para>
      We already know that &MessageEvent; is generated whenever data is
      received and the <methodname>messageReceived</methodname> handler method
      will be invoked.  Let us put some code into the
      <methodname>messageReceived</methodname> method of the
      <classname>DiscardServerHandler</classname>: 
    </para>
    <programlisting>@Override
public void messageReceived(&ChannelHandlerContext; ctx, &MessageEvent; e) {
    &ChannelBuffer;<co id="example.discard3.co1"/> buf = (ChannelBuffer) e.getMessage();
    while(buf.readable()) {
        System.out.println((char) buf.readByte());
        System.out.flush();

        <para>
          It is safe to assume the message type in socket transports is always
          &ChannelBuffer;.  &ChannelBuffer; is a fundamental data structure
          which stores a sequence of bytes in Netty.  It's similar to NIO
          <classname>ByteBuffer</classname>, but it is easier to use and more
          flexible.  For example, Netty allows you to create a composite
          &ChannelBuffer; which combines multiple &ChannelBuffer;s reducing
          the number of unnecessary memory copy.
        </para>
        <para>
          Although it resembles to NIO <classname>ByteBuffer</classname> a lot,
          it is highly recommended to refer to the API reference.  Learning how
          to use &ChannelBuffer; correctly is a critical step in using Netty
          without difficulty.

  <section>
    <title>Writing an Echo Server</title>
    <para>
      So far, we have been consuming data without responding at all.  A server,
      however, is usually supposed to respond to a request.  Let us learn how to
      write a response message to a client by implementing the 
      <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc862">ECHO</ulink> protocol,
      where any received data is sent back. 
    </para>
    <para>
      The only difference from the discard server we have implemented in the
      previous sections is that it sends the received data back instead of
      printing the received data out to the console.  Therefore, it is enough
      again to modify the <methodname>messageReceived</methodname> method:
    </para>
    <programlisting>@Override
public void messageReceived(&ChannelHandlerContext; ctx, &MessageEvent; e) {
    &Channel;<co id="example.echo.co1"/> ch = e.getChannel();
    ch.write(e.getMessage());
}</programlisting>
    <calloutlist>
      <callout arearefs="example.echo.co1">
        <para>
          A &ChannelEvent; object has a reference to its associated &Channel;.
          Here, the returned &Channel; represents the connection which received
          the &MessageEvent;.  We can get the &Channel; and call the
          <methodname>write</methodname> method to write something back to
          the remote peer. 
        </para>
      </callout>

    <para>
      If you run the <command>telnet</command> command again, you will see the
      server sends back whatever you have sent to it.

      <literal>org.jboss.netty.example.echo</literal> package of the

  <section>
    <title>Writing a Time Server</title>
    <para>
      The protocol to implement in this section is the
      <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc868">TIME</ulink> protocol.
      It is different from the previous examples in that it sends a message,
      which contains a 32-bit integer, without receiving any requests and 
      loses the connection once the message is sent.  In this example, you
      will learn how to construct and send a message, and to close the
      connection on completion.
    </para>
    <para>
      Because we are going to ignore any received data but to send a message
      as soon as a connection is established, we cannot use the
      <methodname>messageReceived</methodname> method this time.  Instead,
      we should override the <methodname>channelConnected</methodname> method.
      The following is the implementation:
    </para>
    <programlisting>package org.jboss.netty.example.time;

public class TimeServerHandler extends &SimpleChannelHandler; {

    @Override
    public void channelConnected(&ChannelHandlerContext; ctx, &ChannelStateEvent; e) {<co id="example.time.co1"/>
        &Channel; ch = e.getChannel();
        
        &ChannelBuffer; time = &ChannelBuffers;.buffer(4);<co id="example.time.co2"/>
        time.writeInt(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000);
        
        &ChannelFuture; f = ch.write(time);<co id="example.time.co3"/>
        
        f.addListener(new &ChannelFutureListener;() {<co id="example.time.co4"/>
            public void operationComplete(&ChannelFuture; future) {
                &Channel; ch = future.getChannel();
                ch.close();
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public void exceptionCaught(&ChannelHandlerContext; ctx, &ExceptionEvent; e) {
        e.getCause().printStackTrace();
        e.getChannel().close();
    }
}</programlisting>
    <calloutlist>
      <callout arearefs="example.time.co1">
        <para>
          As explained, <methodname>channelConnected</methodname> method will
          be invoked when a connection is established.  Let us write the 32-bit
          integer that represents the current time in seconds here.
        </para>
      </callout>
      <callout arearefs="example.time.co2">
        <para>
          To send a new message, we need to allocate a new buffer which will
          contain the message.  We are going to write a 32-bit integer, and
          therefore we need a &ChannelBuffer; whose capacity is
          <literal>4</literal> bytes.  The &ChannelBuffers; helper class is
          used to allocate a new buffer.  Besides the
          <methodname>buffer</methodname> method, &ChannelBuffers; provides a
          lot of useful methods related to the &ChannelBuffer;.  For more
          information, please refer to the API reference.
        </para>
        <para>
          On the other hand, it is a good idea to use static imports for
          &ChannelBuffers;:
          <programlisting>import static org.jboss.netty.buffer.&ChannelBuffers;.*;
...
&ChannelBuffer;  dynamicBuf = dynamicBuffer(256);
&ChannelBuffer; ordinaryBuf = buffer(1024);</programlisting>
        </para>
      </callout>
      <callout arearefs="example.time.co3">
        <para>
          As usual, we write the constructed message.
        </para>
        <para>
          But wait, where's the <methodname>flip</methodname>?  Didn't we used
          to call <methodname>ByteBuffer.flip()</methodname> before sending a
          message in NIO?  &ChannelBuffer; does not have such a method because
          it has two pointers; one for read operations and the other for write
          operations.  The writer index increases when you write something to
          a &ChannelBuffer; while the reader index does not change.  The reader
          index and the writer index represents where the message starts and
          ends respectively.
        </para>
        <para>
          In contrast, NIO buffer does not provide a clean way to figure out
          where the message content starts and ends without calling the
          <methodname>flip</methodname> method.  You will be in trouble when
          you forget to flip the buffer because nothing or incorrect data will
          be sent.  Such an error does not happen in Netty because we have
          different pointer for different operation types.  You will find it
          makes your life much easier as you get used to it -- a life without
          flipping out!
        </para>
        <para>
          Another point to note is that the <methodname>write</methodname>
          method returns a &ChannelFuture;.  A &ChannelFuture; represents an
          I/O operation which has not yet occurred.  It means, any requested
          operation might not have been performed yet because all operations
          are asynchronous in Netty.  For example, the following code might
          close the connection even before a message is sent:
        </para>
        <programlisting>&Channel; ch = ...;
ch.write(message);
ch.close();</programlisting>
        <para>
          Therefore, you need to call the <methodname>close</methodname>
          method after the &ChannelFuture;, which was returned by the
          <methodname>write</methodname> method, notifies you when the write
          operation has been done.  Please note that, <methodname>close</methodname>
          also might not close the connection immediately, and it returns a
          &ChannelFuture;.
        </para>
      </callout>
      <callout arearefs="example.time.co4">
        <para>
          How do we get notified when the write request is finished then?
          This is as simple as adding a &ChannelFutureListener; to the returned
          &ChannelFuture;.  Here, we created a new anonymous &ChannelFutureListener;
          which closes the &Channel; when the operation is done.
        </para>
        <para>
          Alternatively, you could simplify the code using a pre-defined
          listener:
          <programlisting>f.addListener(&ChannelFutureListener;.CLOSE);</programlisting>

    <title>Writing a Time Client</title>
    <para>
      Unlike DISCARD and ECHO servers, we need a client for the TIME protocol
      because a human cannot translate a 32-bit binary data into a date on a
      calendar.  In this section, we discuss how to make sure the server works
      correctly and learn how to write a client with Netty.
    </para>
    <para>
      The biggest and only difference between a server and a client in Netty
      is that different &Bootstrap; and &ChannelFactory; are required.  Please
      take a look at the following code:

    <programlisting>package org.jboss.netty.example.time;

        int port = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);

        &ChannelFactory; factory =
            new &NioClientSocketChannelFactory;<co id="example.time2.co1"/>(
                    Executors.newCachedThreadPool(),
                    Executors.newCachedThreadPool());

        &ClientBootstrap; bootstrap = new &ClientBootstrap;<co id="example.time2.co2"/>(factory);

        bootstrap.setPipelineFactory(new &ChannelPipelineFactory;() {
            public &ChannelPipeline; getPipeline() {
                return &Channels;.pipeline(new TimeClientHandler());
            }
        });
        
        bootstrap.setOption("tcpNoDelay"<co id="example.time2.co3"/>, true);
        bootstrap.setOption("keepAlive", true);

      Dealing with a Stream-based Transport
    </title>
    <section>
      <title>
        One Small Caveat of Socket Buffer
      </title>
      <para>
        In a stream-based transport such as TCP/IP, received data is stored
        into a socket receive buffer.  Unfortunately, the buffer of a
        stream-based transport is not a queue of packets but a queue of bytes.
        It means, even if you sent two messages as two independent packets, an
        operating system will not treat them as two messages but as just a
        bunch of bytes.  Therefore, there is no guarantee that what you read
        is exactly what your remote peer wrote.  For example, let us assume
        that the TCP/IP stack of an operating system has received three packets:
      </para>
      <programlisting>+-----+-----+-----+
| ABC | DEF | GHI |
+-----+-----+-----+</programlisting>
      <para>
        Because of this general property of a stream-based protocol, there's
        high chance of reading them in the following fragmented form in your
        application:
      </para>
      <programlisting>+----+-------+---+---+
| AB | CDEFG | H | I |
+----+-------+---+---+</programlisting>
      <para>
        Therefore, a receiving part, regardless it is server-side or
        client-side, should defrag the received data into one or more meaningful
        <firstterm>frames</firstterm> that could be easily understood by the
        application logic.  In case of the example above, the received data
        should be framed like the following:

        The First Solution
      </title>
      <para>
        Now let us get back to the TIME client example.  We have the same
        problem here.  A 32-bit integer is a very small amount of data, and it
        is not likely to be fragmented often.  However, the problem is that it
        <emphasis>can</emphasis> be fragmented, and the possibility of
        fragmentation will increase as the traffic increases.
      </para>
      <para>
        The simplistic solution is to create an internal cumulative buffer and
        wait until all 4 bytes are received into the internal buffer.  The
        following is the modified <classname>TimeClientHandler</classname>
        implementation that fixes the problem:
      </para>
      <programlisting>package org.jboss.netty.example.time;

import static org.jboss.netty.buffer.&ChannelBuffers;.*;

import java.util.Date;

public class TimeClientHandler extends &SimpleChannelHandler; {

    private final &ChannelBuffer; buf = dynamicBuffer();<co id="example.time3.co1"/>

    @Override
    public void messageReceived(&ChannelHandlerContext; ctx, &MessageEvent; e) {
        &ChannelBuffer; m = (&ChannelBuffer;) e.getMessage();
        buf.writeBytes(m);<co id="example.time3.co2"/>
        
        if (buf.readableBytes() &gt;= 4) {<co id="example.time3.co3"/>
            long currentTimeMillis = buf.readInt() * 1000L;
            System.out.println(new Date(currentTimeMillis));
            e.getChannel().close();
        }
    }

    @Override

            logic.  Otherwise, Netty will call the
            <methodname>messageReceived</methodname> method again when more
            data arrives, and eventually all 4 bytes will be cumulated.

        The Second Solution
      </title>
      <para>
        Although the first solution has resolved the problem with the TIME
        client, the modified handler does not look that clean.  Imagine a more
        complicated protocol which is composed of multiple fields such as a
        variable length field.  Your &ChannelHandler; implementation will
        become unmaintainable very quickly.
      </para>
      <para>
        As you may have noticed, you can add more than one &ChannelHandler; to
        a &ChannelPipeline;, and therefore, you can split one monolithic
        &ChannelHandler; into multiple modular ones to reduce the complexity of
        your application.  For example, you could split
        <classname>TimeClientHandler</classname> into two handlers:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              <classname>TimeDecoder</classname> which deals with the
              fragmentation issue, and
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              the initial simple version of <classname>TimeClientHandler</classname>.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
        Fortunately, Netty provides an extensible class which helps you write
        the first one out of the box:
      </para>
      <programlisting>package org.jboss.netty.example.time;

public class TimeDecoder extends &FrameDecoder;<co id="example.time4.co1"/> {

            return null; <co id="example.time4.co3"/>
        }

          </para>
        </callout>
      </calloutlist>
      <para>
        Now that we have another handler to insert into the &ChannelPipeline;,
        we should modify the &ChannelPipelineFactory; implementation in the
        <classname>TimeClient</classname>:
      </para>
      <programlisting>        bootstrap.setPipelineFactory(new &ChannelPipelineFactory;() {
            public &ChannelPipeline; getPipeline() {

                        new TimeDecoder(),
                        new TimeClientHandler());
            }
        });</programlisting>
      <para>
        If you are an adventurous person, you might want to try the
        &ReplayingDecoder; which simplifies the decoder even more.  You will
        need to consult the API reference for more information though.
      </para>

        Additionally, Netty provides out-of-the-box decoders which enables
        you to implement most protocols very easily and helps you avoid from

      Speaking in POJO instead of ChannelBuffer
    </title>
    <para>
      All the examples we have reviewed so far used a &ChannelBuffer; as a
      primary data structure of a protocol message.  In this section, we will
      improve the TIME protocol client and server example to use a 
      <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POJO">POJO</ulink> instead of a
      &ChannelBuffer;.
    </para>
    <para>
      The advantage of using a POJO in your &ChannelHandler; is obvious;
      your handler becomes more maintainable and reusable by separating the
      code which extracts information from &ChannelBuffer; out from the
      handler.  In the TIME client and server examples, we read only one
      32-bit integer and it is not a major issue to use &ChannelBuffer; directly.
      However, you will find it is necessary to make the separation as you
      implement a real world protocol.
    </para>
    <para>
      First, let us define a new type called <classname>UnixTime</classname>.
    </para>
    <programlisting>package org.jboss.netty.example.time;

import java.util.Date;

public class UnixTime {
    private final int value;

    public String toString() {
        return new Date(value * 1000L).toString();
    }
}</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can now revise the <classname>TimeDecoder</classname> to return
      a <classname>UnixTime</classname> instead of a &ChannelBuffer;. 
    </para>
    <programlisting>@Override
protected Object decode(
        &ChannelHandlerContext; ctx, &Channel; channel, &ChannelBuffer; buffer) {

        <para>
          &FrameDecoder; and &ReplayingDecoder; allow you to return an object
          of any type.  If they were restricted to return only a
          &ChannelBuffer;, we would have to insert another &ChannelHandler;
          which transforms a &ChannelBuffer; into a
          <classname>UnixTime</classname>.

    UnixTime m = (UnixTime) e.getMessage();
    System.out.println(m);
    e.getChannel().close();
}</programlisting>
    <para>
      Much simpler and elegant, right?  The same technique can be applied on
      the server side.  Let us update the
      <classname>TimeServerHandler</classname> first this time:
    </para>
    <programlisting>@Override
public void channelConnected(&ChannelHandlerContext; ctx, &ChannelStateEvent; e) {

    &ChannelFuture; f = e.getChannel().write(time);
    f.addListener(&ChannelFutureListener;.CLOSE);
}</programlisting>
    <para>
      Now, the only missing piece is an encoder, which is an implementation of
      &ChannelHandler; that translates a <classname>UnixTime</classname> back
      into a &ChannelBuffer;.  It's much simpler than writing a decoder because
      there's no need to deal with packet fragmentation and assembly when
      encoding a message.

          differently.  A &ChannelEvent; can be either an
          <firstterm>upstream</firstterm> or <firstterm>downstream</firstterm>
          event depending on the direction where the event flows.
          For instance, a &MessageEvent; can be an upstream event when called

          when called for <methodname>writeRequested</methodname>.

          in the &ChannelPipeline;.

        <para>
          On the other hand, it is a good idea to use static imports for

      Shutting Down Your Application
    </title>
    <para>
      If you ran the <classname>TimeClient</classname>, you must have noticed
      that the application doesn't exit but just keep running doing nothing.
      Looking from the full stack trace, you will also find a couple I/O threads

      gracefully, you need to release the resources allocated by &ChannelFactory;.

          simple as calling its <methodname>releaseExternalResources()</methodname>
          method.  All resources including the NIO <classname>Selector</classname>s
          and thread pools will be shut down and terminated automatically.

      Shutting down a client was pretty easy, but how about shutting down a
      server?  You need to unbind from the port and close all open accepted
      connections.  To do this, you need a data structure that keeps track of
      the list of active connections, and it's not a trivial task.  Fortunately,
      there is a solution, &ChannelGroup;.
    </para>
    <para>
      &ChannelGroup; is a special extension of Java collections API which
      represents a set of open &Channel;s.  If a &Channel; is added to a
      &ChannelGroup; and the added &Channel; is closed, the closed &Channel;
      is removed from its &ChannelGroup; automatically.  You can also perform
      an operation on all &Channel;s in the same group.  For instance, you can
      close all &Channel;s in a &ChannelGroup; when you shut down your server.
    </para>
    <para>
      To keep track of open sockets, you need to modify the
      <classname>TimeServerHandler</classname> to add a new open &Channel; to
      the global &ChannelGroup;, <varname>TimeServer.allChannels</varname>:

          connections will be closed asynchronously.  To notify when all

      In this chapter, we had a quick tour of Netty with a demonstration on how
      to write a fully working network application on top of Netty.  More
      questions you may have will be covered in the upcoming chapters and the
      revised version of this chapter.  Please also note that the
      <ulink url="&Community;">community</ulink> is always waiting for your
      questions and ideas to help you and keep improving Netty based on your
      feed back.
