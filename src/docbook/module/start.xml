  <title>Getting Started</title>
  <para>
    This chapter tours around the core constructs of Netty with simple
    examples to let you get started with Netty easily.  You should be able to
    write a network application on top of Netty right away when you are at the
    end of this chapter.

    If you prefer the top-down approach in learning something, you might want
    to start from <xref linkend="architecture"/> and get back here.

    <title>Minimum Requirement</title>
    <para>
      The minimum requirements to run the examples which are introduced in
      this chapter are just two; the latest version of Netty release and JDK
      1.5 or above.  The latest version of Netty is available in
      <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/netty/downloads.html">the project
      download page</ulink>.  To get the right version of JDK, please refer to
      your preferred JDK vendor's web site.  
    </para>
    <para>
      Is that all?  To tell the truth, you should find these two are just
      enough to implement almost any type of protocols.  Otherwise, please
      feel free to
      <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/netty/community.html">contact the Netty
      project team </ulink> and let us know what's missing.

    <title>Writing a Discard Server</title>
    <para>
      The most simplistic protocol in the world is not 'Hello, World!' but 
      <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc863">DISCARD</ulink>.  It's
      a protocol which discards any received data without any response.
    </para>
    <para>
      What you are supposed to do to implement the DISCARD protocol is to log
      the received data, and that's all.  Let's start straight from the handler
      implementation, which handles I/O events generated by Netty.
