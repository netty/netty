/**
 * A {@link ByteBuffer} pool dedicated for {@link SslHandler} performance
 * improvement.
 * <p>
 * In most cases, you won't need to create a new pool instance because
 * {@link SslHandler} has a default pool instance internally.
 * <p>
 * The reason why {@link SslHandler} requires a buffer pool is because the
 * current {@link SSLEngine} implementation always requires a 17KiB buffer for
 * every 'wrap' and 'unwrap' operation.  In most cases, the actual size of the
 * required buffer is much smaller than that, and therefore allocating a 17KiB
 * buffer for every 'wrap' and 'unwrap' operation wastes a lot of memory
 * bandwidth, resulting in the application performance degradation.
