/**
 * Forwards a upstream {@link ChannelEvent} to an {@link Executor}.
 * <p>
 * You can implement various thread model by adding this handler to a
 * {@link ChannelPipeline}.  The most common use case of this handler is to
 * add a {@link ExecutionHandler} which was specified with
 * {@link OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor}:
 * <pre>
 * ChannelPipeline pipeline = ...;
 * pipeline.addLast("decoder", new MyProtocolDecoder());
 * pipeline.addLast("encoder", new MyProtocolEncoder());
 *
 * // HERE
 * <strong>pipeline.addLast("executor", new {@link ExecutionHandler}(new {@link OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor}(16, 1048576, 1048576)));</strong>
 *
 * pipeline.addLast("handler", new MyBusinessLogicHandler());
 * </pre>
 * to utilize more processors to handle {@link ChannelEvent}s.  You can also
 * use other {@link Executor} implementation than the recommended
 * {@link OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor}.
