/**
 * Specifies if the same instance of the annotated {@link ChannelHandler} type
 * can be added to more than one {@link ChannelPipeline}.
 * <p>
 * All handler types are expected to specify this annotation.  Otherwise you
 * will be warned in runtime.  Only two values are allowed for this annotation:
 * {@code "all"} and {@code "one"}.
 * <p>
 * Please note that this annotation doesn't prevent a handler annotated with
 * the value {@code "one"} from being added to more than one pipeline.  This
 * annotation is used for documentation purpose only.
 *
 * <h3>{@code ChannelPipelineCoverage("all")}</h3>
 *
 * {@code "all"} means you can add the same instance of the annotated handler
 * type to more than one {@link ChannelPipeline}.  It means the member
 * variables of the handler instance is shared among multiple channels and it
 * is designed to be OK to do so (or there's nothing to share.)  The following
 * code shows an example of a handler type annotated with {@code "all"} value:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class StatelessHandler extends SimpleChannelHandler {
 *
 *     // No state properties - you are safe to add the same instance to
 *     //                       multiple pipelines.
 *
 *     public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e) {
 *         // Prepend a length field to the message.
 *         ChannelBuffer body = (ChannelBuffer) e.getMessage();
 *         ChannelBuffer header = ChannelBuffers.buffer(4);
 *         header.writeInt(body.readableBytes());
 *
 *         // Create a message prepended with the header and send a new event.
 *         ChannelBuffer message = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, body);
 *         Channels.fireMessageReceived(ctx, message, e.getRemoteAddress());
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>{@code ChannelPipelineCoverage("one")}</h3>
 *
 * {@code "one"} means you must create a new instance of the annotated handler
 * type for each new channel.  It means the member variables of the handler
 * instance can not be shared at all, and violating this contract will lead
 * the handler to a race condition.  The following code shows an example of a
 * handler type annotated with {@code "one"} value:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class StatefulHandler extends SimpleChannelHandler {
 *
 *     // Stateful property - adding the same instance to multiple pipelines
 *     //                     can lead to a race condition.
 *     private int messageId;
 *
 *     public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e) {
 *         // Prepend a message ID and length field to the message.
 *         ChannelBuffer body = (ChannelBuffer) e.getMessage();
 *         ChannelBuffer header = ChannelBuffers.buffer(8);
 *         header.writeInt(messageId);
 *         header.writeInt(body.readableBytes());
 *
 *         // Update the stateful property.
 *         messageId ++;
 *
 *         // Create a message prepended with the header and send a new event.
 *         ChannelBuffer message = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, body);
 *         Channels.fireMessageReceived(ctx, message, e.getRemoteAddress());
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
