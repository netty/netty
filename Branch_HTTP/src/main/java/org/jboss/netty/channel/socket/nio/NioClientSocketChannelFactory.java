/**
 * A {@link ClientSocketChannelFactory} which creates a client-side NIO-based
 * {@link SocketChannel}.  It utilizes the non-blocking I/O mode which was
 * introduced with NIO to serve many number of concurrent connections
 * efficiently.
 *
 * <h3>How threads work</h3>
 * <p>
 * There are two types of threads in a {@link NioClientSocketChannelFactory};
 * one is boss thread and the other is worker thread.
 *
 * <h4>Boss thread</h4>
 * <p>
 * One {@link NioClientSocketChannelFactory} has one boss thread.  It makes
 * a connection attempt on request.  Once a connection attempt succeeds,
 * the boss thread passes the connected {@link Channel} to one of the worker
 * threads that the {@link NioClientSocketChannelFactory} manages.
 *
 * <h4>Worker threads</h4>
 * <p>
 * One {@link NioClientSocketChannelFactory} can have one or more worker
 * threads.  A worker thread performs non-blocking read and write for one or
 * more {@link Channel}s in a non-blocking mode.
 *
 * <h3>Life cycle of threads and graceful shutdown</h3>
 * <p>
 * All threads are acquired from the {@link Executor}s which were specified
 * when a {@link NioClientSocketChannelFactory} is created.  A boss thread is
 * acquired from the {@code bossExecutor}, and worker threads are acquired from
 * the {@code workerExecutor}.  Therefore, you should make sure the specified
 * {@link Executor}s are able to lend the sufficient number of threads.
 * It is the best bet to specify {@linkplain Executors#newCachedThreadPool() a cached thread pool}.
 * <p>
 * Both boss and worker threads are acquired lazily, and then released when
 * there's nothing left to process.  All the related resources such as
 * {@link Selector} are also released when the boss and worker threads are
 * released.  Therefore, to shut down a service gracefully, you should do the
 * following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>close all channels created by the factory,</li>
 * <li>call {@link ExecutorService#shutdownNow()} or {@link ExecutorService#shutdown()}
 *     for all executors which were specified to create the factory, and</li>
 * <li>call {@link ExecutorService#awaitTermination(long, TimeUnit)}
 *     until it returns {@code true}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Please make sure not to shut down the executor until all channels are
 * closed.  Otherwise, you will end up with a {@link RejectedExecutionException}
 * and the related resources might not be released properly.
