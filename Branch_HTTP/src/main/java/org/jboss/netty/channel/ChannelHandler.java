/**
 * Handles or intercepts a {@link ChannelEvent}, and sends a
 * {@link ChannelEvent} to the next or previous handler in a
 * {@link ChannelPipeline}.
 *
 * <h3>Sub-types</h3>
 * <p>
 * This is a tag interface.  There are two sub-interfaces which processes
 * a received event actually, one for upstream events and the other for
 * downstream events:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ChannelUpstreamHandler} handles and intercepts a upstream {@link ChannelEvent}.</li>
 * <li>{@link ChannelDownstreamHandler} handles and intercepts a downstream {@link ChannelEvent}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * You will also find more detailed explanation from the documentation of
 * each sub-type about how an event is interpreted when it goes upstream and
 * downstream respectively.
 *
 * <h3>The context object</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link ChannelHandler} is provided with a {@link ChannelHandlerContext}
 * object.  The {@link ChannelHandler} is supposed to interact with the
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} it belongs to via the context object.  Using the
 * context object, the {@link ChannelHandler} can pass events to the next
 * or previous handler or modify the behavior of the pipeline by adding or
 * removing a handler for example.
 *
 * <h3>Additional resources worth reading</h3>
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the {@link ChannelEvent} documentation to find out what a
 * upstream event and a downstream event are and what fundamental differences
 * they have, if you didn't read yet.
